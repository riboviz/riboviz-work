# Open science as an undergraduate.

What is open science 
Open science is where a scientific process – including information on; experiments, software, failures, development, and end results - is completely transparent, easily accessible, and free to all. The undergrad project described in this article focused on working with the data analysis pipeline for ribosome profiling data, riboviz (https://github.com/riboviz/riboviz). riboviz is an example of an open software as all of the code needed to run it is accessible on GitHub, along with information on errors and developments in the form of issue tickets. This accessibility means that there is greater reproducibility, as anyone can try it or learn how to use it. This is a common theme of open science. In the long run this leads to a better quality of research, and better code quality, as more people are able to check processes.

How it differed from a traditional project
A traditional project, in theory, would involve designing and attempting an experiment, or scouring literature with the goal of answering a research question. This would potentially involve working with ‘trade secrets’ and would likely end with the submission of the final project leaving no other trace of any contribution in the lab. Our project involved jumping into a team working on the riboviz data analysis pipeline, and contributing to the project in the form of adding new datasets, testing the pipeline and its usability from the perspective of complete novices. Our work is documented on GitHub and publicly accessible, providing proof of our contributions to other projects in addition to our own projects. This kind of documentation would likely not be the available had we completed a traditional project. 
Compared to a traditional project, it is possible that contact hours were different. With a more traditional project the contact hours could go either way – with a lab-based project there would likely be a lot of contact hours, with students being in the lab with their supervisor. Alternatively for a literature-based research project, or a community outreach project, there would likely be fewer contact hours, as the student would likely only need guidance rather than constant supervision. We did not have any in-person contact hours. This was partially due to covid, but also due to the project being completely computer based. However, we were able to attend regular meetings with multiple labs, or with our supervisors, and we posted regular updates on the lab slack channel, using the Standup Report method, to keep our supervisors updated on our progress. This was supported by our supervisors being able to see issue tickets and commits as we worked on different tasks. However, the cost of this is that we potentially missed out on gaining practical lab skills. 

What was it like
We had the freedom to come into a lab where we were encouraged to take our projects in any direction of interest, while still being guided towards contributing useful material to the wider community. The open-sourced nature of the project allowed for wider collaboration with other members of the lab and cooperating with groups across the world. It provided more variation and more potential for learning new skills as you were free to aid in different projects, in addition to your own, without the complication of the projects being confidential. 
Completing an open science project was a very exciting experience, though rather intimidating as it felt like we were contributing to a larger project than if we had been doing an isolated experiment or literature review. The idea that everything we did could be seen by others and had the potential to help them fuelled this feeling. Knowing that experts within the field could examine the code you wrote or the conclusions you reached created an additional layer of motivation in terms of maintaining high quality work that could be understood by others. Every aspect of the project being freely available also removed the anxiety that would have arisen if we had been dealing with confidential ideas or processes, such as testing potential antibiotics. Instead of hiding trade secrets, we were able to learn from the work of others. Additionally, there was more room for dialogue with other students completing open science projects. This was a valuable aid as it allowed us to bounce ideas off each other compared to the isolation of a closed project that could not be discussed. 

How did we learn the tools 
To complete our projects we needed to be able to confidently use command line, Git, GitHub, the university supercomputer, and the data analysis pipeline riboviz. Early in the project we were given a tutorial on using Git and GitHub by our supervisor, Flic. This was extremely helpful and as the tutorial materials were stored on GitHub we were able to refer back to them any time we were feeling lost or confused. We were also pointed in the direction of learning materials produced by The Carpentries team (https://carpentries.org/ ), including a course called ‘The Unix Shell’ which gave a solid understanding of using command line to navigate and manipulate files. Within the first few weeks of the project, it became clear that we would be unable to run large datasets through the riboviz pipeline on a 4GB laptop, so we needed to learn how to remotely access the university’s supercomputer. Using resources provided by the university, we learnt how to navigate the supercomputer, submit jobs and run interactive sessions.
The most important step of the project was learning how to use the data analysis pipeline riboviz  (https://github.com/riboviz/riboviz ). Fortunately, the pipeline is reasonably well documented which made the experience slightly smoother. We were able to provide feedback on documentation while we were learning how to run the pipeline, and contributed to any improvements. Time and practice meant that by the end of the project we were confidently running datasets through riboviz and writing our own visualisation code. The experience highlighted how important it is to document the use of scripts and code, which means we will be able to write better code in the future. 

What was good or bad
The open-science nature of the project simplified communicating about it with other members of the lab when we were all working virtually. Though it was intimidating to be working with experts from around the world at such an early stage of our careers, it was valuable experience. Additionally, as everything was documented in the form of issues and commits on GitHub, our contributions to the overall project is available for any future employer to see, which might not have been the case if working out of a private lab book.
When we first started the project, some of the documentation was confusing at times, as we had never worked with the software before, or anything like it. However, this meant we were able to  provide feedback, and ultimately make the software more novice friendly. 
We were also dropped in the deep end as during our first official week there was a ‘hackathon’ going on. In the long run, this one week ‘trial by fire’ made everything else seem easy in comparison, and it meant our supervisors were both completely focused on this project while we were starting, so could help us adjust to the new environment. 
Overall, the project gave us some valuable skills for further study and working with open science. We learned to prioritise tasks based on their need within the group rather than for our individual needs. We also gained better debugging skills, knowing where to look in documentation and on google to help us solve problems. And overall, we became better at team communication such as how to update issue tickets on GitHub to be as informative and useful as possible.

Impact of covid
We chose our projects in September 2020, then worked on them full time from January to May 2021, during the covid pandemic. All projects that were offered had to be adapted to the time, as lab-based projects were not feasible during the constantly changing restrictions that came throughout 2020 and 2021. This meant disruptions to planned lab-based projects. Luckily the riboviz project was designed to be a computer based, meaning we were able to work from home effectively, with as little disruption as possible.  Sadly, during our project we never met anyone from the lab in person, which could have left us feeling extremely isolated. Fortunately, the lab was very welcoming, especially in allowing us to attend all meetings and journal clubs. The open science nature of the project came with the social benefit of being able to enthusiastically discuss the project with family and friends, which was extremely helpful in these times of working from home and lockdowns, as it was the main focus of our lives for many months.

I section – what did I take away from this 
If you are an undergrad considering what direction to take your studies try to complete an undergraduate project in a field you are considering studying, even if you have no prior experience. I was considering completing an MSc in bioinformatics and therefore picked a bioinformatics-based project. I found the experience of stepping outside of my comfort zone and into a field where I had little experience daunting but very valuable. The project provided a positive experience and a fantastic learning curve which confirmed my initial interest in the field and allowed me to gain confidence and competence within coding and software. 

My top takeaways 
-	Being able to access other researchers work helped speed up the project. For example, when trying to create transcriptome annotation files for a new example species, I was able to look at pre-existing code and use it as a starting point for learning which functions and packages could be used. This saved me from starting from scratch and helped guide me
-	It is easier to learn when resources are available to refer back to
-	Open Science is like a group project. Except the world is your group and they won’t affect your grade.
