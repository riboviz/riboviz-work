# Open science as an undergraduate.

## What is open science 
[UNESCO](https://en.unesco.org/science-sustainable-future/open-science) defines open-science as an idea "to allow scientific information, data and outputs to be more widely accessible (Open Access) and more reliably harnessed (Open Data) with the active engagement of all the stakeholders (Open to Society)". This idea of accessible research can be applied to all aspects of science, from highly funded projects to undergraduate projects. And with great accessibility comes greater reproducibility. In the long run this leads to better research and code quality, as more people are able to check procedures and results. The undergrad project described in this article involved working with the data analysis pipeline for ribosome profiling data, [riboviz](https://github.com/riboviz/riboviz) to analyse translation dynamics in two yeast species, _Saccharomyces cereviciae_ and _Schizosaccaromyces pombe_. riboviz is an example of an open software as all of the code required to run it is accessible on GitHub, along with information on errors and software developments documented in issue tickets.

## Freedom to share information and anxiety. 
Being students studying doing a Biotechnology Honours course, there was the potential to work on a variety of projects, with varying levels of openness, including projects working with trade secrets or compounds with theraputic potential. In a talk prior to picking our projects, we were told a story of an undergraduate who had broken their disclosure agreement, leading to the name of the drug they were working on being released on Twitter. The lab's competitors were able to find it, and this mistake cost the lab a lot of money. The idea of potenitally leaking intellectual property caused a lot of anxiety. Working on an open science project removed this risk and this fear. 

## How it differed from a traditional project
A traditional project, in theory, would involve designing and attempting an experiment, or scouring literature with the goal of answering a research question. This would potentially involve working with ‘trade secrets’ and would likely end with the submission of the final project. Any impact on the hosting lab, for example contributions leading to a publication, would not be visible to those outside the lab until a publication is made, which may be long after the student has left. Our project involved jumping into a team working on the riboviz data analysis pipeline, and contributing to the overall development of riboviz in the form of adding new datasets, testing the pipeline, and commenting on its usability from the perspective of complete novices. Our work is documented on GitHub and is publicly accessible, providing proof of our contributions to the overarching project in addition to our own projects. As our work is publicly accessible it provides concrete evidence of our abilities which can be accessed by potential employers. This instant visibility of our work would likely not be available had we completed a traditional project.   

Compared to a traditional project, it is possible that contact hours were different. The contact hours of an undergraduate project depend heavily on the type of project – with a lab-based project requiring lots of contact hours, with students being in the lab with their supervisor. Alternatively for a literature-based research project, or a community outreach project, there would likely be fewer contact hours, as the student would require more guidance rather than constant supervision. We did not have any in-person contact hours. This was partially due to the covid pandemic, but also due to the project being completely computer based. However, we were able to attend regular meetings with multiple labs, or with our supervisors, and we posted regular updates on the lab [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/) channel, using the Standup Report method, to keep our supervisors updated on our progress. This was supplemented by issue tickets and commits on GitHub which our supervisors were able to see and comment on. However, the cost of a virtual computer-based project is that we potentially missed out on improving and gaining new practical lab skills. 

## What was it like
We had the freedom to join a supportive lab where we were encouraged to take our projects in any direction of interest, while still being guided towards contributing useful material to the wider community. The open-sourced nature of the project allowed for wider collaboration with other members of the lab and cooperating with research groups across the world. It provided more variation and more potential for learning new skills as you were free to aid in different projects, in addition to your own, without the complication of the projects being confidential. 

Completing an open-science project was a very exciting experience, though rather intimidating as it felt like we were contributing to a larger project rather than completing an isolated experiment or literature review. The idea that everything we did could be seen by others and had the potential to help them fuelled this feeling. Knowing that experts within the field could examine the code we had written or critique the conclusions we had reached created an additional layer of motivation in terms of maintaining high quality work that could be understood by others. Every aspect of the project being freely available also removed the anxiety that would have arisen if we had been dealing with confidential ideas or processes, for example testing potential antibiotics. Instead of hiding trade secrets, we were able to freely collaborate and learn from the work of others. Additionally, there was more room for dialogue with other students completing open-science projects. This was a valuable aid as it allowed us to bounce ideas off each other compared to the stress and isolation of a closed project that could not be discussed with peers. 

## What was good or bad
The open-science nature of the project simplified communicating about it with other members of the lab when we were all working virtually. Though it was intimidating to be working with experts from around the world at such an early stage of our careers, it was valuable experience. Additionally, as everything was documented in the form of issues and commits on GitHub, our contributions to the overall project is available for any future employer to see, which might not have been the case if working out of a private lab book.
When we first started the project, some of the documentation was confusing at times, as we had never worked with the software before, or anything like it. However, this meant we were able to provide feedback, and ultimately make the software more novice friendly by improving user documentation. 

It did feel like we were dropped in the deep end as during our first official week there a ‘hackathon’ took place. This involved all individuals working on riboviz focusing solely on its development for that week. Having never worked in a lab before, let alone in a bioinformatics one, this was rather overwhelming. Everyday ended with a meeting, where everyone reported on their day, so there was pressure to learn quickly and be able to share progress. These meetings were like going on an intense language immersion course, and it felt like our brains were melting by the end of each day. There was a steep learning curve, but in the long run, this one week of ‘trial by fire’ made everything else seem more manageable in comparison. Additionally, we were able to see how a large group could operate efficiently through issue tickets and Git, which at the time were still intimidatingly new to us. The hackathon also meant our supervisors were both completely focused on this project while we were starting, so they could help us adjust to the new environment.

Overall, the project gave us some valuable skills for further study and working with open-science. We learned to prioritise tasks based on their importance within the group rather than for our individual needs. We also gained better debugging skills, knowing where to look in documentation and on google to help us solve problems. 

Our communication skills were greatly improved by interacting with our supervisors and the lab group in the course of the project through our Standup Reports and issue tickets on GitHub. The importance of communicating progress and obstacles frequently in a precise and informative manner, especially as all communication occurred virtually, quickly became obvious to avoid confusion and get help more quickly. This development is clearer now that we occasionally return to issue tickets written in the early stages of the project, and curse at our past selves for documenting the problem, and more importantly the solution, so poorly. 

## How did we learn the tools 
To complete our projects we needed to be able to confidently use the command line, Git, GitHub, the university supercomputer, and the data analysis pipeline riboviz. Early in the project we were given a tutorial on using Git and GitHub by our supervisor, Flic. This was extremely helpful and, as the tutorial materials were stored on GitHub, we were able to refer back to them any time we were feeling lost or confused. We were also pointed in the direction of learning materials produced by The [Carpentries team](https://carpentries.org/), including a course called ‘The Unix Shell’ which provided a solid understanding of using the command line to navigate and manipulate files. Within the first few weeks of the project, it became clear that we would be unable to run large datasets through the riboviz pipeline on a underpowered personal laptop, so we needed to learn how to remotely access the university’s supercomputer. Using resources provided by the university, we learned how to navigate the supercomputer, submit jobs and run interactive sessions.

The most important step of the project was learning how to use the data analysis pipeline [riboviz](https://github.com/riboviz/riboviz). Fortunately, the pipeline is reasonably well documented which made the experience slightly smoother. We were able to provide feedback on documentation while we were learning how to run the pipeline, and contributed to the improvement of user documentation. Time and practice meant that by the end of the project we were confidently running datasets through riboviz and writing our own visualisation code. The experience highlighted how important it is to document the use of scripts and code, which means we will be able to write better code in the future. 

## Impact of covid
We chose our projects in September 2020, then worked on them full time from January to May 2021, during the COVID19 pandemic. All projects that were offered had to be adapted, as lab-based projects were not feasible during the constantly changing restrictions that came throughout 2020 and 2021. This meant disruptions to planned lab-based projects. Luckily the riboviz project was designed to be a computer based project, meaning we were able to work from home effectively, with as little disruption as possible. Sadly, during our project we never met anyone from the lab in person, which could have left us feeling extremely isolated. Fortunately, the lab was very welcoming, allowing us to attend all meetings and journal clubs. The open-science nature of the project came with the social benefit of being able to enthusiastically discuss the project with family and friends, which was extremely helpful in these times of working from home and lockdowns, as the project was the main focus of our lives for many months.

## Advice for undergrads selecting their projects
If you are an undergrad considering what direction to take your studies try to complete an undergraduate project in a field you are considering entering into, even if you have no prior experience. I was considering completing an MSc in bioinformatics and therefore picked a bioinformatics-based project. I found the experience of stepping outside of my comfort zone and into a field where I had little experience daunting but very valuable. The project provided a positive experience and a fantastic learning curve which confirmed my initial interest in the field and allowed me to gain confidence and competence within coding and software. 

## My top takeaways 
-	Being able to access other researchers work helped speed up the project. For example, when trying to create transcriptome annotation files for a new example species, I was able to look at pre-existing code and use it as a starting point for learning which functions and packages could be used. This saved me from starting from scratch and helped guide me
-	It is easier to learn when resources are available to refer back to
-	Open-Science is like a group project. Except the world is your group and they won’t affect your grade. 
-	Documenting your work helps you, aids others and helps them help you
