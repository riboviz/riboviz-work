# Open science in undergraduate projects

This repository contains an in-progress article about open science in undergraduate research projects for the Biochemist magazine, written by members of the [Wallace lab](https://ewallace.github.io/) that worked on the [riboviz](https://github.com/riboviz/riboviz) project.

It aims to address:
* What it was like doing open science
* How we went about learning new tools
* What was different from a traditional honours project
* What was fun or easy
* What was hard or less fun
* What we learned
* What advice we would give to others
